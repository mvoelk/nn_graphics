# Artificial Neural Network related TikZ Graphics

If you like TikZ and need some 'inspiration' for your Artificial Neural Network related graphics, then this could be what you are looking for.  
I initially wanted editable versions of the images I found on [olah's blog](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs) that I could use later for my [master's thesis](http://83.169.39.135/thesis/thesis.pdf), so I started playing around with TikZ. The results are now contained in this repository.
